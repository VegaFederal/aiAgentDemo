# CI/CD Pipeline Guide

This document outlines the continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline setup for AWS projects.

## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying your application to AWS environments. This automation helps ensure consistent deployments and reduces the risk of human error.

## Pipeline Architecture

The pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Source**: Code is pulled from the repository when changes are pushed
2. **Build**: Application code is compiled and packaged
3. **Test**: Automated tests are run to validate the build
4. **Deploy to Development**: Successful builds are deployed to the development environment
5. **Approval**: Manual approval step for production deployments
6. **Deploy to Production**: Approved changes are deployed to production

## Implementation Options

### GitHub Actions (Default)

The template includes GitHub Actions workflows in the `.github/workflows` directory:

- `main.yml`: Triggered on pushes to the main branch
- `pull-request.yml`: Triggered on pull requests to validate changes

#### Setup Instructions

1. Configure AWS credentials as GitHub secrets:
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
   - `AWS_REGION`

2. Customize the workflow files as needed for your project

### AWS CodePipeline Alternative

For projects that prefer using AWS native services:

1. Create a CodePipeline with the following stages:
   - Source: CodeCommit or GitHub connection
   - Build: CodeBuild project
   - Test: CodeBuild project with test commands
   - Deploy: CloudFormation/CDK deployment

2. Sample CloudFormation template for CodePipeline setup is available in:
   `/infrastructure/cloudformation/ci-cd-pipeline.yaml`

## Environment Configuration

### Development Environment

- Automatically deployed on successful builds
- Used for integration testing and feature validation
- Resources are tagged with `Environment: dev`

### Production Environment

- Deployed after manual approval
- Requires successful deployment to development first
- Resources are tagged with `Environment: prod`

## Deployment Strategies

### Blue/Green Deployment

For zero-downtime deployments:

1. Create a new (green) environment identical to the current (blue) environment
2. Deploy the new version to the green environment
3. Test the green environment
4. Switch traffic from blue to green
5. Decommission the blue environment when no longer needed

### Canary Deployment

For gradual rollout:

1. Deploy the new version to a small percentage of the infrastructure
2. Monitor for any issues
3. Gradually increase the percentage until 100%
4. Roll back if issues are detected

## Rollback Procedures

In case of deployment failures:

1. Automatic rollback: The pipeline automatically reverts to the last successful deployment if tests fail
2. Manual rollback: Use the "Rollback" option in CloudFormation or run the deployment with the previous version

## Monitoring Deployments

Monitor deployments using:

1. CloudWatch Logs for application logs
2. CloudWatch Alarms for critical metrics
3. AWS X-Ray for tracing requests
4. CloudTrail for API activity

## Security Considerations

1. Use IAM roles with least privilege for the CI/CD pipeline
2. Scan code for vulnerabilities before deployment
3. Encrypt sensitive data in the pipeline using AWS Secrets Manager
4. Audit pipeline access and activities

## Best Practices

1. Keep the build and deployment scripts in the same repository as the application code
2. Use infrastructure as code for all environment provisioning
3. Make deployments idempotent and repeatable
4. Include rollback mechanisms in your deployment process
5. Test the deployment process itself regularly

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Failed builds**: Check build logs for compilation errors or failed tests
2. **Deployment failures**: Verify IAM permissions and CloudFormation/CDK templates
3. **Timeout issues**: Increase timeout settings for long-running deployments
4. **Resource conflicts**: Use logical IDs consistently to avoid duplicate resource creation
