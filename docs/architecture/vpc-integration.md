# VPC Integration Guide

## Overview

This project is designed to deploy into the company's existing VPC infrastructure. All resources that require VPC connectivity will be deployed into the pre-configured VPC and subnets managed by the company administrators.

## VPC Details

- **VPC ID**: `vpc-03de7ad5a4c7c1822`
- **Subnet IDs**: `subnet-02615277a84a5fcb4,subnet-005d1ad197eb59c2b`

## Integration Points

### Network Resources

All network-dependent resources in this project will be deployed into the existing VPC infrastructure. This includes:

- EC2 instances
- RDS databases
- Lambda functions (when VPC access is required)
- Load balancers
- ECS tasks

### Security Groups

Security groups will be created within the existing VPC but managed by this project. Ensure that any security group rules comply with company network policies.

### Connectivity

For resources that need to communicate with external services:

1. Ensure the subnet has appropriate route tables configured
2. Check that security groups allow the necessary outbound traffic
3. Verify that network ACLs permit the required traffic

## Deployment Considerations

1. **Subnet Selection**: Choose appropriate subnets based on the resource requirements:
   - Public subnets for internet-facing resources
   - Private subnets for internal resources

2. **Availability Zones**: Distribute resources across multiple AZs for high availability

3. **IP Address Management**: Be mindful of IP address consumption in the shared VPC

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter connectivity issues:

1. Verify subnet configurations
2. Check security group rules
3. Validate network ACL settings
4. Ensure route tables are properly configured
5. Contact the network administrator if issues persist
