# AWS Architecture Best Practices

This document outlines the recommended best practices for AWS architecture design in your projects.

## General Principles

1. **Design for failure**: Build systems that anticipate and recover from failure
2. **Implement elasticity**: Design your systems to scale in and out automatically based on demand
3. **Decouple components**: Loosely coupled systems are more resilient and easier to scale
4. **Think parallel**: Design workloads to be distributed and processed in parallel
5. **Use managed services**: Leverage AWS managed services when possible to reduce operational overhead

## Security Best Practices

1. **Implement least privilege access**: Grant only the permissions necessary to perform a task
2. **Enable traceability**: Log and monitor all API calls and resource access
3. **Apply security at all layers**: Defense in depth approach (network, subnet, instance, application, data)
4. **Automate security best practices**: Use infrastructure as code to enforce security controls
5. **Protect data in transit and at rest**: Use encryption for sensitive data
6. **Keep people away from data**: Reduce or eliminate the need for direct access to data
7. **Prepare for security events**: Have incident response plans in place

## Reliability Best Practices

1. **Test recovery procedures**: Regularly test how your system recovers from failures
2. **Automatically recover from failure**: Use auto-scaling and automated failover
3. **Scale horizontally**: Increase capacity by adding more instances rather than larger ones
4. **Stop guessing capacity**: Use auto-scaling to match demand
5. **Manage change through automation**: Use infrastructure as code and CI/CD pipelines

## Performance Efficiency Best Practices

1. **Democratize advanced technologies**: Use managed services to implement complex technologies
2. **Go global in minutes**: Deploy your system in multiple AWS Regions
3. **Use serverless architectures**: Eliminate the need to manage servers
4. **Experiment more often**: Easy to experiment with different architectures
5. **Consider mechanical sympathy**: Understand how AWS services are designed to work

## Cost Optimization Best Practices

1. **Adopt a consumption model**: Pay only for what you use
2. **Measure overall efficiency**: Measure the business output of the system and the costs associated
3. **Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting**: AWS does the heavy lifting of data center operations
4. **Analyze and attribute expenditure**: Identify system usage and costs
5. **Use managed services**: Reduce cost of ownership by using managed services

## Operational Excellence Best Practices

1. **Perform operations as code**: Define your infrastructure using CloudFormation or CDK
2. **Make frequent, small, reversible changes**: Minimize the scope of changes to reduce risk
3. **Refine operations procedures frequently**: Evolve your procedures as your workload evolves
4. **Anticipate failure**: Test your failure scenarios and validate your understanding of their impact
5. **Learn from all operational failures**: Drive improvement through lessons learned

## Service-Specific Best Practices

### Amazon EC2
- Use instance metadata service for accessing instance-specific data
- Use Spot Instances for flexible, fault-tolerant workloads
- Use Auto Scaling Groups for high availability and elasticity

### Amazon S3
- Use versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of objects
- Use lifecycle policies to transition objects to lower-cost storage classes
- Use server-side encryption for sensitive data

### Amazon RDS
- Use Multi-AZ deployments for high availability
- Use Read Replicas for read scaling
- Use automated backups and snapshots for point-in-time recovery

### AWS Lambda
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task
- Minimize cold starts by optimizing function size and runtime
- Reuse execution context to improve performance

### Amazon DynamoDB
- Design tables with access patterns in mind
- Use sparse indexes to minimize storage and throughput costs
- Use on-demand capacity mode for unpredictable workloads
